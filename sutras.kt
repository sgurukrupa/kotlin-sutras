/* Haribol!
 *
 * Sutra - 1
 * ---------
 *
 * Everything is an object; we can call member functions and properties on any variable.
 * "Some of the types can have special internal representation - for example,
 * numbers, characters and booleans can be represented as primitive values at runtime - 
 * but to the user they look like ordinary classes."
 *
 * Sutra - 2
 * ---------
 *
 * Four types of integers:
 *
 *    Type    Size (bits)      Range
 * ---------------------------------------
 * 1. Byte -   8          [-128, 127]
 * 2. Short - 16        [-32768, 32767]
 * 3. Int -   32        [-2e31, 2e31 - 1]
 * 4. Long -  64        [-2e63, 2e63 - 1]
